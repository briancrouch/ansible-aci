# ansible-aci
Using Ansible for Cisco ACI Deployment and Orchestration.

## Overview
This is demonstration of Ansible, an open source automation tool, which is used to configure a Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) fabric. 

## Prior Work

This repo has been revised to reflect the changes and enhancements in the Cisco ACI modules released first in Ansible 2.4 and later releases. I have 
created a [deprecated](https://github.com/joelwking/ansible-aci/tree/deprecated) branch with the original work, and have revised the master branch to focus on using the ACI modules released with Ansible.
